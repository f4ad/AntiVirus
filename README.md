<!-- TOC -->
* Build a Python script that can scan a computer using the connected API with VirusTotal.
* The script has two classes (agent and server), so an agent will scan files and the server will make the final decision.
* The final decision will be displayed as an HTML result on the server.
* If results are obtained from the VirusTotal API, the agent script will calculate the risk percentage. If it is higher than 25%, the file will be removed from the disk.
